         <h2>Lack of motivation (YELLOW) 
         </h2>

         <h4>You don’t want to do it? You don’t want to open that computer and do your homework? You don’t have the energy, the mindset, the desire to start? You postpone everything and stress yourself out which just leads to more self destruction… Yeah, you lack motivation. This is very mutual to many students. It’s either hard to start or to keep going, or worse… They struggle with both. 
         </h4>

         <h4>Now, there are TONS of different strategies out there that could help you but one thing that you must start with if you haven’t already is to set up a clear goal. Where do you want to go after school? How do you achieve this? What do you have to do? All these important questions are a power source for your motivation. How? Well, when you see the situation clearly and understand that to become something you have to do something you start making some adjustments, actions. To know your goal isn’t easy, but it’s a very good start because when it feels like your lack of motivation is becoming an obstacle you remind yourself of your goals. 
         </h4>

         <h4>Another tip is to award yourself. Give yourself a day to treat yourself, to have fun. Maybe even challenge yourself and say that if you finish your assignment or get a good grade on a test you’ll buy that shoe you’ve always wanted. Maybe even ask a parent or a friend to give you something a little extra if you achieve a goal. This tip will surely help you a lot especially if you're competition-oriented. 
         </h4>

         <h4>One more thing is to keep a checklist, which you would naturally have if you're a good planner. Or even sub-goals. This is very helpful because it will visualize how far you've come, to see how the list decreases each time you do something to achieve your goal. This helps you mentally and motivationally. This is why your surroundings are important as well. Hang with people who also have goals, who will remind you of your goals because there is something called feedback and feedforward which is a big key to motivation. 
         </h4>

         <h4>Eventually and hopefully (if you actually listen to our tips and tricks) your motivation will get stronger. It is all about your mindset my friend, you can do it! Everything will become much easier for you if you're motivated, i promise so GO AHEAD AND ACHIEVE YOUR DREAMS!
         </h4>

         <h4>Good job and good luck!</h4>
