         <h2>A bad planner (GREEN) 
         </h2>
  
         <h4>This is a very common rabbit hole that many students fall into and sadly it is not easy to get up from there, but with the right mindset nothing is impossible.  Now, how do you know if you’ve fallen for the trap?  Do you always tell yourself “I'll do it later” and end up having tons of homework to do when you least notice it? Do you never feel like you have time for school or do you tell yourself that when you come home you're gonna study for the exam on Friday but end up watching your show instead, and now you're all clueless and stressed for Friday? Well then, yes. You are indeed a pretty bad planner. 
         </h4>

         <h4>Now how do you change your addicting routines? Easy, you just need to actually start doing your assignments. Easier said than done but your computer is not gonna open up itself.  Plan your study days, write your assignments down on a note, computer or maybe even on your phone with help of an app called Google Keep. If you start with this you are already half way through. Now that you’re aware of the assignments and upcoming exams you have, then what do you do? You write down the deadlines. Easy peasy. 
         </h4>

         <h4>And the next step, the most important one! You have to actually do them…. Yes, you read that right. But don’t start with just any assignment, work with the ones that have the closest deadline. Plan which ones you have to do first so that you are at the correct pace and turn in the assignments at the correct time. BOM! Good grades are on their way. Promise yourself to do your assignments for like 20-30 min almost every day, trust me it will feel like a second. And if you feel like you don’t even have time to do that then you have too much on your schedule my friend… specialize and prioritize school. Don’t workout the whole day, don’t hangout with friends the whole day, don’t be busy the whole day. Spare yourself some minutes for your future and do your homework. Maybe even study some extra minutes one day so the next day you’re able to do something else. Instead of being on your phone for an hour, open your computer and start your assignments and for the remaining 30 min, go ahead and open TikTok to do your thing. 
         </h4>

         <h4>Eventually and hopefully (if you actually listen to our tips and tricks) you will feel like 20-30 min is too little and increase it a nudge. When you’ve sacrificed some plans to study and prioritize school will you not only be a good planner, but also even a good student. 
         </h4>

         <h4>Good job and good luck!</h4>
