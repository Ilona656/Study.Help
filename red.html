         <h2>Inferior environment and distractions (RED)
         </h2>

         <h4>Now is the noises, the people you hang with or the environment a big source to why it’s hard for you to study? Ever thought about it maybe being a distraction? Because if you easily start talking to someone who's nearby when you study or are always on your phone each time you get a notification then maybe you should move settings and put your phone in sleeping mode. This might sound obvious but distractions waste your time. If you're going to focus THEN FOCUS!
         </h4>

         <h4>Think about it, what usually makes you look away from your homework. Is it the noises in the background, is it the people, your phone, environment, the music, ANYTHING. Think about it and change location. This is very important yet very different depending on us students. You like listening to music while studying but end up singing the lyrics? Well then, listen to a melody or a song you don’t know. You don’t like it when people ask you questions or talk in the background? Well then, go to the library or a place you’re familiar with that nobody goes to. You don’t like it when it’s too quiet? Simple, go to a coffee shop. You don’t like studying in tight areas, big areas, messy areas? Simple, move location to a place you're comfortable and can focus. Figure yourself out and find your favorite study place. 
         </h4>

         <h4>Now, is it your own thoughts that distracts you? You start thinking about something else and just look at the wall. Yeah, that is actually very normal. But it is not because you're easily distracted, but because you lose focus and concentration my friend. To fix this you gotta take breaks/pauses. Take a walk, eat a fruit, drink water, anything to let your mind rest. Make a plan on how many breaks you need and when to take those breaks. Is it each 20 min or each hour and for how long, maybe 10min, 5min? Test yourself and make a plan for what makes you feel the best. 
         </h4>

         <h4>Eventually and hopefully (if you actually listen to our tips and tricks) you’ll have easier to focus and have less distractions. You got to find what fits you the best, it’s not going to take a day but after a while it will surely be worth it and not only for school but also for your future!

         <h4>Good job and good luck!</h4>
