        <h4>Our name is Tanja and Ilona and we ourselves are students at the age of 19. We went to Tullinge Gymnasium last year. We had our own struggles with school so trust us when we say we can relate.

        <h4> “This right here is a brilliant idea! I myself will recommend this website to students who ask me for help”.
        </h4>

        <h2>Resources
        </h2>

        <h4>We’ve gathered all our resources with help of interviewing students, friends and teachers. We’ve structured and summarized the biggest and most relatable characters named in colors.  We’ve asked grownups, special pedagogues and yet again teachers for tips and tricks to help us students with school and of course we have looked up in many trustworthy websites and picked the best and most effective tips and tricks. Not only that but we did an experiment where we tested these life hacks to see if they truly are effective and after months of testing these tips we wrote down were the best ones that we can almost up to 99% guarantee will make it easier for you to study.
