         <h2>Bad memory (BLUE) 
         </h2>
 
         <h4>This is relatable to all the students, but at different levels. If you feel like your memory has blocked your way of wanting to do your assignments because no matter how many times you go through it you still won’t remember, and this has even created a dark circle where no studying means no good grades so eventually you’ve given up. Yeah… that practically means you have a pretty bad memory, and if you don’t but also struggle with that part then don’t worry because we have tips and tricks to help you out. 
         </h4>

         <h4>Lack of memory can lead to lack of motivation, and good planning leads to good memory since structure makes the brain work better, but we dig deeper into that in other characters, let us first help your brain. We have something called a memory system which could be seen as a muscle you can build and make stronger aka your memory. For example, rehearse with a friend, family member or after class ask your classmates what the teacher just talked about, that right there is excellent push ups my friend. Everything you do with your body is connected to your brain, for example bad sleeping schedule, eating less, not working out… All of this increases your memory loss. That is why the older you get, the worse your memory becomes because we do less for our bodys benefits. So change your routines, go out for a run(part of your cardiovascular health strengthens your memory. This is scientifically proven), get yourself at least 8 hours of sleep, eat three times a day and BOOM! Healthy brain, healthy grades. 
         </h4>

         <h4>Still feel like your daily routines aren't the reason for your bad memory? No worries, we got more solutions. Brain workouts… Yes, they do indeed exist and it’s not that complicated. Basically, what you have to do is associate the information you need to memorize into different images. Let concepts become a number or a story in your head. Let yourself connect your imagination and fantasy to remember as well as possible, trust us IT WORKS, search it up!
         </h4>

         <h4>Eventually and hopefully (if you actually listen to our tips and tricks) your memory will become better when you least notice it. You do got to be patient with it though, but we believe in you, you need to believe in you.
         </h4>

         <h4>Good job and good luck!</h4>
